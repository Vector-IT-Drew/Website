About Vector New York

Leasing Reimagined for Owners—Built to Impress, Designed to Deliver

At Vector New York, we’ve redefined what it means to lease luxury real estate in New York City. Since 2021, we’ve grown into one of the city’s most trusted leasing operations, now overseeing more than 15,000 units across a diverse range of properties—from iconic luxury towers with 500+ residences and boutique high-end buildings, to historic walk-ups, co-ops, and thoughtfully managed affordable housing. Our reach is broad, but our standards remain uncompromising—no matter the asset class, we treat every unit like a flagship.

We are not a traditional brokerage. Instead, we operate as a specialized leasing department for owners and management firms, delivering speed, efficiency, and consistent results at scale. Our approach replaces the outdated “one agent does everything” model with a modern, department-based system supported by advanced automation and real-time data tracking. This structure allows us to move faster, provide transparency, and execute with precision—keeping vacancy rates low and property values high.

A Better Leasing Experience for Owners and Tenants

Our commitment to excellence doesn't end with the owner. At Vector, we believe great leasing is a win-win—where landlords see performance, and tenants feel at home. That’s why every part of our process, from scheduling tours to lease execution, is designed to be fast, clear, and responsive.

Whether we're presenting a high-floor residence with skyline views or a thoughtfully staged studio in a historic brownstone, our in-house creative team ensures every listing feels elevated. From luxury-focused virtual staging to tailored video content, we present your property the way it deserves to be seen.

Built for Scale. Tuned for Precision.

We track performance at every stage of the leasing cycle—measuring listing traffic, lease turnaround times, agent response rates, and deal outcomes. These insights don’t just drive decisions—they allow us to optimize focus, streamline communication, and deliver unmatched visibility to our partners.

For investors and property owners, this means knowing exactly where attention is needed and where we’re winning. For renters, it means a smoother, smarter path to their next home.
