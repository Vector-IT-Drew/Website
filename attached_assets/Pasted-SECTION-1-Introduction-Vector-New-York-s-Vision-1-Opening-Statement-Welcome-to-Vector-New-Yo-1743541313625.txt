	4.	What Sets Vector New York Apart

Unit Lifecycle Phases
Occupied
This phase provides a stable record of all currently leased units, offering a clear view with minimal upkeep until movement to the next phase. Any updates, such as tenant requests or lease modifications, are documented to ensure an accurate snapshot until the unit approaches its renewal date.
Renewal Process
Beginning 120 days before lease expiration the Renewal Process phase, we leverage AI-driven tools—such as chatbots and automated email workflows—to initiate early engagement with tenants. This approach offers a cost-effective alternative to human labor, accelerating initial outreach and gathering essential information well before lease expiry. By the time a human team member steps in for direct negotiation, they’re equipped with detailed insights from the data collection, allowing for a more prepared and efficient conversation. This combination of automation and strategic human touch enables us to provide a responsive, streamlined experience that meets tenant needs while keeping costs in check.
Pre-Lease
A unit enters the Pre-Lease phase when a non-renewal decision is confirmed. This proactive stage enables our leasing team to list the apartment, push targeted marketing, and channel inquiries from adjacent properties, minimizing any lapse in tenancy. By coordinating showings with the current tenant and leveraging high-quality media like video walkthroughs, we ensure maximum visibility. Our team works to secure a new lease that aligns with the current lease's expiry, avoiding gaps in income and optimizing the lease start timeline. Units in this phase are flagged for a more hands-on approach, allowing us to maintain leasing momentum.
Vacant
If pre-leasing doesn’t yield a tenant by lease-end, the unit enters the Vacant phase. Here, we prioritize swift yet strategic action, analyzing market trends to position the unit competitively. Weekly team reviews assess pricing, potential renovations, and other enhancements to make the apartment attractive to new tenants. Our extensive marketing network includes not only public listings but a broad network of broker partners, maximizing visibility and engagement. Through active advertising across digital platforms and broker communities, we keep vacancies as short as possible.
Active Deal
When an application or good faith deposit is received, the unit moves to Active Deal status. This phase is powered by automation, ensuring smooth progression from application to lease signing. Our deal flow manager, combined with automated lease generation and quality checks, maintains high standards of accuracy and efficiency. Automated alerts prompt applicants and management to keep things on track, while coordination with building staff and tenant handovers are carefully managed. Once lease terms are finalized and confirmed, the unit re-enters the Occupied phase, with all relevant details recorded for future reference.
This approach is built to provide landlords with real-time, actionable insights at each phase, empowering them to make decisions based on up-to-the-minute data. Our live rent roll captures the lifecycle of every unit, ensuring transparency, efficiency, and consistent performance across the portfolio.
